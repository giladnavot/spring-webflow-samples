The <SwmToken path="/pom.xml" pos="6:4:8" line-data="	&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-webflow-samples&lt;/artifactId&gt;">`spring-webflow-samples`</SwmToken> repository is an official collection of sample projects for the Spring Web Flow project. It provides various examples that demonstrate different aspects of the Spring Web Flow. These samples can be run on a server or built into a war file for further use. The repository contains different directories, each representing a different sample project. For instance, there are directories for <SwmToken path="/pom.xml" pos="16:4:6" line-data="		&lt;module&gt;webflow-showcase&lt;/module&gt;">`webflow-showcase`</SwmToken>, <SwmToken path="/pom.xml" pos="14:4:6" line-data="		&lt;module&gt;primefaces-showcase&lt;/module&gt;">`primefaces-showcase`</SwmToken>, <SwmToken path="/pom.xml" pos="13:4:6" line-data="		&lt;module&gt;booking-faces&lt;/module&gt;">`booking-faces`</SwmToken>, and <SwmToken path="/pom.xml" pos="12:4:6" line-data="		&lt;module&gt;booking-mvc&lt;/module&gt;">`booking-mvc`</SwmToken>, each containing code related to different aspects of Spring Web Flow.

## Modules

### Booking faces

Booking faces is a module that provides a sample implementation of a booking system using Spring Web Flow. It includes classes and interfaces that define the structure and behavior of bookings, such as the <SwmToken path="/booking-faces/src/main/java/org/springframework/webflow/samples/booking/Booking.java" pos="31:4:4" line-data="public class Booking implements Serializable {">`Booking`</SwmToken> class and the <SwmToken path="/booking-mvc/src/main/java/org/springframework/webflow/samples/booking/BookingService.java" pos="9:4:4" line-data="public interface BookingService {">`BookingService`</SwmToken> interface. The <SwmToken path="/booking-faces/src/main/java/org/springframework/webflow/samples/booking/Booking.java" pos="31:4:4" line-data="public class Booking implements Serializable {">`Booking`</SwmToken> class represents a booking made by a user for a hotel, and includes methods for getting and setting booking details. The <SwmToken path="/booking-mvc/src/main/java/org/springframework/webflow/samples/booking/BookingService.java" pos="9:4:4" line-data="public interface BookingService {">`BookingService`</SwmToken> interface defines the operations that can be performed on bookings, such as finding bookings by username, finding hotels by criteria, creating bookings, persisting bookings, and cancelling bookings. The module also includes CSS styles for the booking system's web interface.

### Primefaces showcase

The Primefaces showcase is a demonstration of how to use the Primefaces library in conjunction with Spring Web Flow. It is structured as a Maven project, with its dependencies defined in the <SwmPath>[pom.xml](/pom.xml)</SwmPath> file. The project includes a <SwmToken path="/primefaces-showcase/src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/webflow/jsf/FacesHelper.java" pos="8:4:4" line-data="public class FacesHelper {">`FacesHelper`</SwmToken> class, which provides a method <SwmToken path="/primefaces-showcase/src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/webflow/jsf/FacesHelper.java" pos="17:5:5" line-data="	public boolean isError() {">`isError`</SwmToken> that can be used in a Facelets View to conditionally render a box around messages. This is particularly useful when using PrimeFaces, as it allows for the use of `<p:messages/>` or `<p:growl>`. The project's main entry point is the <SwmPath>[booking-faces/src/main/webapp/index.html](/booking-faces/src/main/webapp/index.html)</SwmPath> file, which redirects the user to the `app/home` URL.
