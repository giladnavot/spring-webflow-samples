# What is BookingService

`BookingService` is an interface in the `booking-faces` module of the Spring Web Flow samples repository. It defines the contract for a service that retrieves hotels and bookings from a backing repository and supports the ability to cancel a booking.

The function `findHotels` is used to find hotels available for booking based on some search criteria. It takes a `SearchCriteria` object, an index of the first result to return, a field to sort by, and a boolean indicating whether the sorting should be in ascending order. It returns a list of hotels meeting the criteria.

```java
    List<Hotel> findHotels(SearchCriteria criteria, int firstResult, String sortBy, boolean ascending);
```

# Usage example

`JpaBookingService` is an example of how to use the `BookingService` interface. It is a JPA-based implementation of the `BookingService` that delegates to a JPA entity manager to issue data access calls against the backing repository. The `EntityManager` reference is provided by the managing container (Spring) automatically.

```java
@Service("bookingService")
@Repository
public class JpaBookingService implements BookingService, Serializable {

	private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

	private EntityManager em;

	@PersistenceContext
	public void setEntityManager(EntityManager em) {
		this.em = em;
	}

	@Transactional(readOnly = true)
	@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
	public List<Booking> findBookings(String username) {
		if (username != null) {
			return em.createQuery("select b from Booking b where b.user.username = :username order by b.checkinDate")
					.setParameter("username", username).getResultList();
		} else {
			return null;
```
