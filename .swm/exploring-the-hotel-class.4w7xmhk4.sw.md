# Hotel Class Structure

The 'Hotel' class is a simple Java class marked with the '@Entity' annotation, indicating that it is a JPA entity. It has fields to store the hotel's id, name, address, city, state, zip, country, and price. Each field has corresponding getter and setter methods. The 'createBooking' method creates a new 'Booking' instance for a given user.
