# The function `today`

The function `today` is called within `validateEnterBookingDetails`. It retrieves the current date, subtracts one day from it, and returns the result. This is used in the context of booking validation to ensure that the booking date is not in the past.

```java
	private Date today() {
		Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
		calendar.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, -1);
		return calendar.getTime();
	}
```

# The function `getTime`

The function `getTime` is called within `today`. It simply returns the current date and time. This is used in the `today` function to get the current date before subtracting one day.

```java
	public Date getTime() {
		return new Date();
	}
```
