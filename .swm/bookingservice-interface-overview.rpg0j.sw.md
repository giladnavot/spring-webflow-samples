# Usage example

`JpaBookingService` is an example of how to use `BookingService`. It implements `BookingService` and provides the implementation for all the functions defined in `BookingService`. It uses a JPA entity manager to issue data access calls against the backing repository.

```java
@Service("bookingService")
@Repository
public class JpaBookingService implements BookingService {

	private EntityManager em;

	@PersistenceContext
	public void setEntityManager(EntityManager em) {
		this.em = em;
	}

	@Transactional(readOnly = true)
	@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
	public List<Booking> findBookings(String username) {
		if (username != null) {
			return em.createQuery("select b from Booking b where b.user.username = :username order by b.checkinDate")
					.setParameter("username", username).getResultList();
		} else {
			return null;
		}
	}
```
