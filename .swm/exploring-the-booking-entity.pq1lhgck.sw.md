title: Exploring the Booking Entity
---
Booking refers to a hotel reservation made by a user. It is represented as an entity in the codebase, with various attributes such as the user making the booking, the hotel being booked, check-in and check-out dates, credit card information, and preferences like smoking and number of beds. The Booking class also includes methods to calculate the total cost and the number of nights for the booking.

	private Long id;

	private User user;

	private Hotel hotel;

	@DateTimeFormat(pattern = "MM-dd-yyyy")
	private Date checkinDate;

	@DateTimeFormat(pattern = "MM-dd-yyyy")

# Booking Class Constructors

The 'Booking' class provides two constructors. The default constructor initializes the check-in and check-out dates to the next two days. The second constructor allows a 'Hotel' and 'User' object to be passed in, setting the hotel and user for the booking.

```java
	public Booking() {
		Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
		calendar.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 1);
		setCheckinDate(calendar.getTime());
		calendar.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 1);
		setCheckoutDate(calendar.getTime());
	}

	public Booking(Hotel hotel, User user) {
		this();
		this.hotel = hotel;
		this.user = user;
	}
```

# Calculating Total Cost and Nights

The 'Booking' class provides methods to calculate the total cost of the booking and the number of nights for the stay. The total cost is calculated by multiplying the price of the hotel by the number of nights. The number of nights is calculated by subtracting the check-in date from the check-out date.

```java
	@Transient
	public BigDecimal getTotal() {
		return hotel.getPrice().multiply(new BigDecimal(getNights()));
	}

	@Transient
	public int getNights() {
		if (checkinDate == null || checkoutDate == null) {
			return 0;
		} else {
			return (int) ((checkoutDate.getTime() - checkinDate.getTime()) / 1000 / 60 / 60 / 24);
		}
	}
```
