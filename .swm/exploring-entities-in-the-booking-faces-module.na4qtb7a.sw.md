title: Exploring Entities in the Booking-Faces Module
---
Entities in the spring-webflow-samples repository, specifically in the booking-faces module, are classes that represent the main objects or concepts in the application. They are typically annotated with @Entity, indicating that they are JPA entities and will be mapped to a database table. For instance, the User class represents a user who can book hotels, and the Hotel class represents a hotel where users may book stays. These entities are used throughout the application, in service classes, controllers, and views.

# User Entity

The User entity represents a user of the application. It has fields for username, password, and name. It is annotated with @Entity, indicating that it is a JPA entity and should be mapped to a database table.

```java
package org.springframework.webflow.samples.booking;

import java.io.Serializable;

import jakarta.persistence.Entity;
import jakarta.persistence.Id;
import jakarta.persistence.Table;

/**
 * A user who can book hotels.
 */
@Entity
@Table(name = "Customer")
public class User implements Serializable {

	private static final long serialVersionUID = -3652559447682574722L;

	private String username;

	private String password;
