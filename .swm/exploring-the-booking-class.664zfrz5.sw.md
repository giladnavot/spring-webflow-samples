This includes basic information like the user who made the booking and the hotel that was booked, as well as details about the booking like the check-in and check-out dates, the number of beds, and whether the user is a smoker.

```java
public class Booking implements Serializable {

	private static final long serialVersionUID = 1171567558348174963L;

	private User user;

	private Hotel hotel;

# Creating a Booking

The Booking class provides a constructor that takes a Hotel and a User object. This constructor is used to create a new booking. It sets the check-in date to the current date and the check-out date to the next day.

```java
	public Booking(Hotel hotel, User user) {
		this.hotel = hotel;
		this.user = user;
		Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
		calendar.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 1);
		setCheckinDate(calendar.getTime());
		calendar.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 1);
		setCheckoutDate(calendar.getTime());
	}
```

# Calculating the Total Cost and Number of Nights

The Booking class includes methods to calculate the total cost of the booking and the number of nights for the stay. The total cost is calculated by multiplying the price of the hotel by the number of nights. The number of nights is calculated by subtracting the check-in date from the check-out date.

```java
	@Transient
	public BigDecimal getTotal() {
		return hotel.getPrice().multiply(new BigDecimal(getNights()));
	}

	@Transient
	public int getNights() {
		if (checkinDate == null || checkoutDate == null) {
			return 0;
		} else {
			return (int) (checkoutDate.getTime() - checkinDate.getTime()) / 1000 / 60 / 60 / 24;
		}
	}
```

## validateEnterBookingDetails Function

The `validateEnterBookingDetails` function validates the booking details. It checks if the check-in date is before the current date and if the check-out date is before the check-in date, and adds error messages if these conditions are not met.

```java
	public void validateEnterBookingDetails(ValidationContext context) {
		MessageContext messages = context.getMessageContext();
		if (checkinDate.before(today())) {
			messages.addMessage(new MessageBuilder().error().source("checkinDate")
					.code("booking.checkinDate.beforeToday").build());
		} else if (checkoutDate.before(checkinDate)) {
			messages.addMessage(new MessageBuilder().error().source("checkoutDate")
					.code("booking.checkoutDate.beforeCheckinDate").build());
		}
	}
```
