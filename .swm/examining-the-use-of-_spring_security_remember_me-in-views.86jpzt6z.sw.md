# How `_spring_security_remember_me` is used in the codebase

In the login form, `_spring_security_remember_me` is used as the name of a checkbox input. When this checkbox is selected by the user, it enables the remember-me functionality.

```html
                <input type="checkbox" name="_spring_security_remember_me" id="remember_me" />
                <label for="remember_me">Don't ask for my password for two weeks:</label>
```

# The functionality and purpose of `_spring_security_remember_me`

The `_spring_security_remember_me` checkbox is part of the Spring Security framework's remember-me authentication feature. When a user checks this box during login, the application will remember the user's session and won't ask for credentials again for a certain period, usually two weeks. This is achieved by storing a remember-me cookie in the user's browser.
