title: Introduction to Webflow Showcase
---
Webflow showcase is a project within the Spring Web Flow samples. It's a Maven project, as indicated by the pom.xml file, and it's packaged as a war file. This project is designed to demonstrate the capabilities of Spring Web Flow, a framework for building web applications in Spring. It includes dependencies on various Spring modules, such as spring-webmvc, spring-jdbc, and spring-orm, as well as on Spring Web Flow itself. The project also uses Apache Tiles for layout, Hibernate Validator for JSR 303 validation, and Log4j for logging.

# Webflow Showcase Endpoints

Understanding the Webflow Showcase Endpoints

<SwmSnippet path="/webflow-showcase/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/spring/controllers.xml" line="15">

## Root Endpoint (/)

The root endpoint (/) is mapped directly to the 'home' view without any controller processing. This means when the application is accessed from the root URL, the 'home' view is returned to the client.

```xml
	<mvc:view-controller path="/" view-name="home" />
```

## Embedded Flow Container Endpoint (/embeddedFlowContainer)

The /embeddedFlowContainer endpoint is also mapped directly to a view with the same name. This endpoint is used to access the 'embeddedFlowContainer' view.

```xml
	<mvc:view-controller path="/embeddedFlowContainer" />
```
