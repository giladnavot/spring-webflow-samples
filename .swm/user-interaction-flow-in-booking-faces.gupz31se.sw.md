title: User Interaction Flow in Booking-Faces

This document will outline a typical user interaction flow from UI to Database in the context of the Spring Web Flow samples. We'll cover:

1. The User Entity
2. The interaction flow from UI to Database

# The User Entity

The `User` class is a JPA entity that represents a user in the system. It is marked with the `@Entity` annotation, making it a managed entity in the JPA context. This means that any changes to the `User` object will be automatically persisted to the database.

```java
package org.springframework.webflow.samples.booking;

import java.io.Serializable;

import jakarta.persistence.Entity;
```

# Interaction Flow from UI to Database

In a typical Spring Web Flow application, the interaction flow from UI to Database involves several steps:

1. The user interacts with the UI, triggering an event (e.g., form submission).
2. The event is handled by a controller method, which may involve validating the user input and populating a model object (e.g., `User`).
3. The model object is then passed to a service layer, which encapsulates the business logic of the application.
4. The service layer interacts with the repository layer, which is responsible for persisting the model object to the database.
5. The repository layer uses JPA to interact with the database. In the case of the `User` entity, any changes to the `User` object will be automatically persisted to the database due to the `@Entity` annotation.
6. Once the data is persisted, the service layer may return some data (e.g., confirmation message) back to the controller.
7. The controller then updates the UI accordingly.
