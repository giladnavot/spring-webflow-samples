Autocomplete in the spring-webflow-samples repository is a feature implemented in the 'primefaces-showcase' module. It is designed to provide suggestions to the user as they type into a form field. This is achieved through the use of a 'Person' class, which represents the data being inputted, and a 'PersonService' class, which provides the logic for generating the autocomplete suggestions.
