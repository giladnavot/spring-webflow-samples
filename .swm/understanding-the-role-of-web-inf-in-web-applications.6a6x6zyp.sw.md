title: Understanding the Role of WEB-INF in Web Applications
---
The `WEB-INF` directory in a web application is a location that provides a secure place to store resources such as classes, libraries, and configuration files that are used by the application. It is not accessible directly from the web and is typically used to store resources that are not intended to be served directly to a user.

In the `booking-mvc` application, the `WEB-INF` directory contains HTML files that define the views of the application. These files are used by the Spring MVC framework to generate the user interface of the application. The `layouts` directory contains a standard layout that is used by multiple views, and the `hotels` directory contains views specific to the hotel booking functionality.

# Thymeleaf Templates

This is an example of a Thymeleaf template used to generate the HTML for the review booking page. It uses Thymeleaf syntax to bind data from the model to the view.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" 
      xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org"
      lang="en">

<head th:replace="layouts/standard.html :: //head">

    <!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
    <!-- This <head> section is only used for static prototyping purposes.             -->
    <!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->

# Messages Properties Files

booking.checkinDate.Future=The check in date must be in the future
booking.checkinDate.beforeToday=The check in date must be a future date
booking.checkinDate.typeMismatch=The check in date must be in the format mm-dd-yyyy

booking.checkoutDate.Future=The check out date must be in the future
