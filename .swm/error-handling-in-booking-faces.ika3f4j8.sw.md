title: Error Handling in Booking-Faces

This document will cover the topic of how error handling is managed across components in the Spring Web Flow samples repository. However, due to the lack of specific context or code references related to error handling in the provided repository context, the document will be based on general practices and principles.

# General Principles of Error Handling

In a typical Spring application, error handling is managed through a combination of try-catch blocks, exception classes, and error views. When an error occurs, it's usually thrown as an exception. This exception can be caught and handled within the component where it occurred, or it can be propagated up to a higher-level component for handling.

# Error Views

In the context of a web application, unhandled exceptions are often directed to an error view, such as a custom error page. This provides a user-friendly way to inform the user that an error has occurred, rather than exposing them to raw error messages or stack traces.

# Exception Classes

Spring provides a number of exception classes that can be used to represent various types of errors. By using these classes, or by creating custom subclasses, you can create a rich hierarchy of error types that can be used to provide detailed information about what went wrong.

# Try-Catch Blocks

Try-catch blocks are used to handle exceptions at the point where they occur. The `try` block contains the code that might throw an exception, and the `catch` block contains the code that will execute if an exception is thrown. This can be used to log the error, display a message to the user, or take some other action.
